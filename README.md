# Project 2 - Continuous Control

## The environment

In this project we will train the Reacher Unity environment. The goal of your agent is to maintain its position at the target location for as many time steps as possible.

- __Set-up__: Double-jointed arm which can move to target locations.
- __Goal__: The agents must move its hand to the goal location, and keep it there.
- __Agent Reward__: +0.1 Each step agent's hand is in goal location.

The observation space consists of 33 variables corresponding to position, rotation, velocity, and angular velocities of the arm. Each action is a vector with four numbers, corresponding to torque applicable to two joints. Every entry in the action vector should be a number between -1 and 1.
